				<h2 style="color:black;"> <strong>Description</strong></h2>
				<p style="color:black;">Just Cause 3 is a 2015 open world action-adventure video game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix. It was announced on November 11, 2014. It is the third game in the Just Cause series and is the sequel to the 2010 video game Just Cause 2. It was released worldwide on December 1, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, receiving positive reviews, with critics praising the open world, destruction mechanics, and its promotion of player agency, while criticizing performance issues and the uninspired narrative.</p>
				<h2 style="color:black;"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>
				<p style="color:black;">Just Cause 3 is an open world third-person action-adventure game that is set on a fictional Mediterranean island known as Medici with Rico Rodriguez set as the protagonist. The map size has been confirmed to be similar to that of the setting of Just Cause 2 with 400 square miles (1,000 km2) being dedicated for the new setting. However, its volumetric terrain has increased to allow more verticality – as a result of this, it is now possible for the player to explore subterranean caverns and to scale buildings more effectively and realistically. The world of the game is composed of five major biomes, with each having unique landmarks and landscapes. A variety of tools are provided to players for traversal in the game. Just Cause 2 '​s signature features – the grappling hook and parachute – reappear with improved mechanics. The focus on chaos and exaggerated physics also remain. A new wingsuit, which is permanently equipped by the player, is featured in the game and allows players to glide across the world in a much faster way. When the player almost reaches the ground while using the wingsuit, they can draw themselves back up in the air by using grapples. Players can switch between using the parachute and wingsuit freely during missions or free-roam. In addition to the equipment provided, a wide range of weapons, like missile launchers and shotgun RPGs, and vehicles, such as fighter aircraft, planes, ships, and exotic cars, are included in the game. These vehicles can be customized by the player and can be used as weapons. Other game mechanics have been overhauled and updated. For example, Rico now has the ability to attach and tether multiple objects together with his grappling hook, while parachuting is more stable and allows players to shoot enemies from the air. Every object and non-playable character can also be hooked by the player with the use of the grappling hook. In-game currency has been left out of Just Cause 3, making the series' supply drops more easily accessible and imaginative for the player. However, this affects difficulty; for example, if the player chooses to ride a tank, the enemy AI matches the power of it and adopts weapons that would be able to take down a tank. Another new feature is giving the character infinite C4. Unlike previous installments that required players to purchase C4, Just Cause 3 instates this weapon to allow for more chaos. In Just Cause 2 players were able to stand on top of moving vehicles but only in the center; players are now allowed to move around on vehicles freely in Just Cause 3. Players can liberate hostile military bases and towns featured in the game; they act as fast travel locations if the liberation is successful. Creativity and destruction are heavily emphasized in Just Cause 3. For instance, many things in the game, including structures like bridges and statues, can be destroyed in a variety of ways. A new mechanic called Rebel Drop was introduced. It allows the player to pause the game to select equipment, weapons, and vehicles through a pause menu. The selected objects are dropped into the game's world and can be used by players. The game also features Challenge Modes. It includes mini-games like wingsuit races and the destruction frenzy mode, in which new objectives and challenges are unlocked when the player destroys an enemy base. Despite the multiplayer mod of Just Cause 2 being well received by players, the game only featured asynchronous multiplayer at launch, in which challenges and leaderboards were included instead of any co-operative or competitive multiplayer mode, as the studio wanted to focus their manpower, time and resources in creating the world of the game.</p>
