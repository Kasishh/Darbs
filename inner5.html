	<h2 style="color:black;"> <strong>Description</strong></h2>

				<p style="color:black;">Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a historical action-adventure open world stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It was released on October 23, 2015, for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on November 19, 2015, for Microsoft Windows. It is the ninth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity. Set within Victorian era London, the game follows twin assassins as they navigate the corridors of organized crime, and take back the city from Templar control. The open world design lets players freely roam London.
</p>
<p  style="color:black;" >The game is played from a third-person view and its world is navigated on foot or by carriage. The game introduces new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics. Players control the two lead protagonists—twins Jacob and Evie Frye—throughout the game's story, switching between them both during and outside of missions. Unlike its direct predecessors, Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay.
Assassin's Creed Syndicate received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the visuals and the likability of the major characters, especially the Frye twins and the antagonist, while criticizing the lackluster ending as well as the aging and repetitive gameplay and mission mechanics, yet saying that it was an improvement over Unity</p>

				<h2 style="color:black;"> <strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>

				<p style="color:black;">Assassin's Creed Syndicate is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view. Players complete quests—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of quests, players can freely roam the open world. Composed of the greater area of Victorian London, consisting of seven boroughs, the world of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is much larger than previous entries in the series. Players can also perform side missions, which were designed to reflect the fight for power in London, and are cohesive to the game's main story.
</p>
<p  style="color:black;" >The game lets players control two characters: twins Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob is a hot-headed brawler, specializing in close combat,while Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her intelligence and wit. The main weapons of Syndicate include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane sword and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife. The game also introduces new systems to navigate the world: a rope launcher, which allows players to rappel up structures, or create a zip-line between buildings; carriages, which can be piloted or simply occupied by players, and can be the setting of fights and parkour chases; and a train, which serves as the main base for players throughout the game. The game has no multiplayer mode, and does not feature a companion app, which was introduced in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.[15]</p>
